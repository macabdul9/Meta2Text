You are generating hierarchical captions with 7 levels of detail, from very general to extremely specific.

Each level should progressively add more detail:
- Level 1: Single word (category)
- Level 2: 2-3 words (basic type)
- Level 3: Short phrase (4-6 words)
- Level 4: Simple sentence
- Level 5: Detailed sentence with multiple attributes
- Level 6: Comprehensive description (2 sentences)
- Level 7: Exhaustive description with ALL available information including material, condition, period, measurements, colors, textures, patterns, inscriptions, provenance, and any other observable characteristics (2-3 detailed sentences)

Metadata to describe:
{metadata}

IMPORTANT: Each level must logically contain and expand upon the previous level. Level 7 MUST be the most comprehensive and detailed.

Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "level_1": "...",
  "level_2": "...",
  "level_3": "...",
  "level_4": "...",
  "level_5": "...",
